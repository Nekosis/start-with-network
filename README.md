# start-with-network
`start-with-network` is a simple Python script that starts a set of applications set in a configuration file when it detects network access. It performs this check by pinging Cloudflare's DNS server, and proceeds to start the programs if it succeeds in connecting to it.

For documentation details, see [start-with-network(1)](start-with-network.1) and [programs-list.conf(5)](programs-list.conf.5).
